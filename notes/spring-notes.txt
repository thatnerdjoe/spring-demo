Intro to Spring
========================
Beans are objects in Java, located within Java packages
The Spring Application Context manages beans
Spring supports loose-coupling by managing beans
    - @Component - denotes a Spring bean object
    - @Autowired - denotes a given bean's dependency
Spring Framework contains modules for essential operations - Beans, JDBC, Web, AOP, etc
Spring Projects are additional packages for applications:
    - Web: microservice web apps
    - Cloud: native cloud apps
    - Data: DB API wrapper (?)
    - Integration: application pattern elements
    - Security: security solutions
    - Batch: batch applications utilities
    - HATEOAS: REST return links/service
    - Etc: Session, Mobile, Web Services, more...
Troubleshoot Spring Framework with the debug log:
    Spring Boot path: src/main/resources/application.properties
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    logging.level.org.springframework = debug
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Benefits of Spring Framework:
    1. Mature testing platforms (JUnit and Mockito)
    2. Reduces verbosity of simple, routine functions (No plumbing code)
    3. Modular and flexible architecture
    4. Continuous improvements

Basic Spring
========================
1. Autowiring Types and Qualifiers
2. Bean Scope & Life Cylce
3. IOC Container & Applicaton Context
4. XML & Java Application Contexts
5. Component Scan
6. External Properties
7. Container & Dependency Injection (CDI)

Autowiring
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
Detects initialized beans required for another bean
Priority must be specified if multiple child beans for a given requirement exist
Autowiring can be accomplished by name or type
    - use type+name to solve @Autowired conflict
Use @Component for interface implementation classes
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
Bean Scope
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
Singleton - only one bean instance is created (default)
Prototype - bean object is created when requested
specify by using:
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_XXX)
Cannot nest a SCOPE_PROTOTYPE bean in a SCOPE_SINGLETON bean without a proxy
    @Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_XXX, proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
*Best practice*: to keep instantiated objects to a minimum
Do not confuse with "Gang of Four" singleton (1 instance per JVM vs. 1 instance per App Context)

Component Scan
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
When Spring components are not in the same package, then it will nto be found by the default component scan
Need to import package and add location into @ComponentScan()
    @ComponentScan("path.to.package")
